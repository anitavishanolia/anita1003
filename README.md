  I'm Anita Saini, a passionate and detail-oriented MERN Stack Developer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Jalandhar.
  I specialize in building scalable, full-stack web applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-centric. I love turning ideas      into clean, intuitive interfaces using tools like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Figma, all backed by robust backend systems built with Node.js and MongoDB.
  I've built tools like ChatPDF with ChatGPT and developed creative applications like an AI-based image generator using ClipDrop API.
  I'm also deeply invested in problem-solving, having solved 550+ DSA problems on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, and love applying logical thinking to    real-world software challenges.
